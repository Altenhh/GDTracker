**GDTracker is a simple and easy-to-use tracker.**

GDTracker is highly inspired by circle-tracker such that it provides the exact same features but modeled after Geometry Dash.

## Development
When developing or debugging the GDTracker codebase, a few prerequisites are required as following:
* An IDE that supports the C# language in automatic completion, and syntax highlighting; examples of such being [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and above, or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

## Contributions
All contributions are appreciated, as to improve the on it's performance and functionality. As this tracker isn't perfect, we would enjoy all additions to the code through bugfixing and ideas. Contributions should be done over an issue or a pull request, to give maintainers a chance to review changes to the codebase.

For new ideas and features, we would prefer for you to write an issue before trying to add it to show the maintainers.
